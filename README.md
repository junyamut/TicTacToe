# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### (Java Swing application)

*Description: This repository contains work based on an exercise from a Udacity course. Full credit for the original concept and most of the code is due to Udacity.*

### Notes
* This is based an old Udacity Java exercise. 
* Intended to introduce Java newbies to 2-dimensional arrays.
* At the same time, to practice on looping strategies to go through such an array.
* Code logic to check if there is already a game winner was implemented by _yours truly_.

#### Tic-tac-toe, also known as **Noughts and Crosses** or **Xs and Os**, is a classic and simple two-player game often played with just paper and pencil.

## How to Play

### Setup
The game is played on a **3x3 grid**, which is created by drawing two vertical lines crossed by two horizontal lines, resulting in nine total spaces.

### The Players and Marks
* There are two players.
* One player uses the mark **"X"** (the crosses).
* The other player uses the mark **"O"** (the noughts).
* The player using "X" traditionally goes first.

### Gameplay and Objective
1.  Players **alternate turns**, placing their mark (X or O) in one of the nine empty squares on the grid.
2.  The primary objective is to be the first player to get **three of their marks in a row**. This can be achieved in any direction: **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally**.
3.  Players must also strategically **block** their opponent from getting three in a row.

### Winning and Ending the Game
* **Win:** The game ends immediately when a player successfully places three of their marks in a straight line.
* **Draw (Cat's Game):** If all nine squares on the grid are filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
